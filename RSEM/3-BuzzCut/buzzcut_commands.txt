Software: buzzcut.pl

Buzzcut needs to be run on the EBSeq.results.genes.txt and RSEM.gene.counts.matrix files, or the EBSeq.results.isoforms.txt and RSEM.gene.counts.matrix files that are created by EBSeq and RSEM. The software will select the differentially expressed genes or isoforms which are higher than the specified threshold. For more information about the avaiable options in buzzcut, type:

perl buzzcut.pl



All files from RSEM must be sorted prior to using buzzcut.pl

Command to sort files:

cat <File_in> | awk 'NR == 1; NR > 1 {print $0 | "sort -k 1,1"}' > <File_out>





Command to select Genes:

perl buzzcut.pl -d EBSeq.results.genes.txt -c RSEM.gene.counts.matrix -o buzzcut-selected.genes.txt -filterP


Command to select Isoforms:

perl buzzcut.pl -d EBSeq.results.isoforms.txt -c RSEM.isoforms.counts.matrix -o buzzcut-selected.isoforms.txt -filterP





Finally, the transpose of the matrix created by buzzcut needs to be created for the elastic net analysis. Use the following command and software:

Software: transpose.jar (Downloaded from the Beagle Imputation Utilities)

cat buzzcut-selected.genes.txt | java -jar transpose.jar > elasticNet.selected.genes.txt
