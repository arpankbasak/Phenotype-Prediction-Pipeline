Software: Cufflinks

(Run for each Sample)

cufflinks <path_to_bam_file> --GTF <path_to_gtf_file>




Intermediate File: Create a file named assembly_list.txt with the paths to all of the transcripts.gtf files created by cufflinks.




Software: CuffMerge

(Run Once)

cuffmerge -g <path_to_gtf_file> assembly_list.txt




Intermediate File: cuffmerge will create merged.gtf which needs to be used in cuffquant.




Software: CuffQuant

(Run for each Sample)

cuffquant <path_to_merged.gtf_file> <path_to_bam_file>




Software: CuffDiff
