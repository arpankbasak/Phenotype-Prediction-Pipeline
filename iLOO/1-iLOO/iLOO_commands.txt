The iLOO.R script can be downloaded at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4454687/bin/pone.0125224.s003.doc

This script requires a data matrix, which can be formed from the tables generated by RSEM. The file required is RSEM.gene.counts.matrix. A script which runs iLOO can be found in iLOO.R. The script requires data matrices that contain only the data for each phenotype. You can generate these from your samples using rsem-generate-data-matrix.
