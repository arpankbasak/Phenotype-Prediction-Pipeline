SeqGSEA requires count tables which are created from .bam/.sam files generated by RSEM or TopHat. For our analysis, specific gene names were desired, so Tophat was used to perform an annotated alignment to the hg19 genome. 


Software: Python scripts provided in SeqGSEA's R Library /extscripts


Prepare the reference annotation:

python prepare_exon_annotation_refseq.py <in.gtf> <out.gff>


Sort all .bam files:

samtools sort -n accepted_hits.bam sorted_accepted_hits.bam


Prepare the count tables:

python count_in_exons.py [options] <flattened_gff_file> <s/bam_file> <output_file>
